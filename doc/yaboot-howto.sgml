<chapt>Yaboot's Purpose
<p>

Yaboot is a bootloader for PowerPC computers (NewWorld PowerMacs and IBM
CHRP). It loads a Linux operating system kernel from an
OpenFirmware-accessible filesystem and initiates operation of the kernel. On
PowerMacs, an included CHRP script can display a multi-OS boot menu which
can launch <prgn>yaboot</prgn> or other operating systems. Utilities are
included to place <prgn>yaboot</prgn> and the associated script on a
non-mountable bootstrap partition.


<chapt>System Requirements
<p>
Motorola PowerPC processors have been used on at least three different
kinds of systems: NuBus, OldWorld PCI, and NewWorld PCI. Nubus systems
include the 6100/7100/8100 line of Power Macintoshes. OldWorld systems
are most Power Macintoshes with a floppy drive and a PCI bus. Most
603, 603e, 604, and 604e based Power Macintoshes, including the 7200,
7300, 7500, 7600, 8500, 8600, 9500, and 9600 are OldWorld
machines. The beige colored G3 systems are also OldWorld.
<p>

<em><prgn>yaboot</prgn> will not work on NuBus or OldWorld machines</em>,
those will require <prgn>quik</prgn> or (for MacOS Pre-9.0.4 only)
<prgn>BootX/miboot</prgn>.

<p>
The NewWorld PowerMacs, for which <prgn>yaboot</prgn> is designed, are
any PowerMacs in translucent colored plastic cases. That includes all
iMacs, iBooks, G4 systems, blue colored G3 systems, and most
PowerBooks manufactured in and after 1999. 


<chapt>Obtaining Yaboot
<p>

Yaboot is included with Debian GNU/Linux installation for PowerPC computers.
Updates for Debian may be downloaded via the normal methods, such as
<prgn>apt-get</prgn>, <prgn>dselect</prgn>, or <prgn>dpkg</prgn>.
Installation of an updated version of <prgn>yaboot</prgn> on your system
does not change your boot configuration; you must use the included
<prgn>ybin</prgn> utility to do that.

<p>

You can also download <prgn>yaboot</prgn> directly from the
<prgn>yaboot</prgn> home page at <url
id="http://penguinppc.org/projects/yaboot">. If you download it using MacOS,
be sure to download using <em>binary</em> (not text) format, and don't let
Stuffit Expander or another utility expand the archive in MacOS.

<p>

You can download the precompiled <file>yaboot-binary-X.Y.tar.gz</file>, or
the source tarball <file>yaboot-X.Y.tar.gz</file>. To unpack the binary
distribution, use the command <tt>tar -zxvpf yaboot-X.Y.tar.gz</tt>. The
components are unpacked into a <file>usr/local/</file> directory inside the
directory where the command was executed.

<p>

To make and install from source, first make sure you have a working compiler
(<prgn>gcc</prgn>) and the <prgn>make</prgn> program installed. (If
not, download the binary yaboot tarball instead of the source.) Then run the
following commands (substitute the actual revision numbers for X and Y):

<p>
<example>
     tar -zxvpf yaboot-X.Y.tar.gz
     cd yaboot-X.Y
     make
     su
     make install
</example>

<chapt>Creating the Bootstrap Partition
<p>

Be sure you have reviewed the <prgn>mac-fdisk</prgn> Basics page at <url
id="http://penguinppc.org/projects/yaboot/doc/mac-fdisk-basics.shtml">. If
you are creating a new Linux installation, the first partition you create
with <prgn>mac-fdisk</prgn> should be the bootstrap partition. Just use the
<prgn>mac-fdisk</prgn> <tt>b</tt> command to automatically create a
bootstrap partition of the proper size and type. If your version of
<prgn>mac-fdisk</prgn> doesn't include the <tt>b</tt> command, use: 

<p>
<example>
     Command (? for help): C xxxx 800k bootstrap Apple_Bootstrap 
</example>
<p>

(Replace xxxx with the starting block number.) A working tarball of a
bootstrap-capable version of mac-fdisk (Debian users already have this
version) is also distributed at <url
id="http://penguinppc.org/projects/eb/">. To install this, use

<example>
     su -
     cd /
     gzip -dc mac-fdisk.tar.gz | tar -xvp
</example>
 
<p>
The bootstrap partition only takes 800k of space. If you are adding a
bootstrap partition to your existing setup, you may have enough free
space on your existing drive without changing other partitions. If
not, you could avoid re-partitioning the entire disk by stealing a
little space from your swap partition. Or <prgn>parted</prgn> would allow
you to resize partitions.

<p>

The bootstrap partition should end up being partition #2, after the
partition map itself but before any other partitions on the disk. You can
easily change the order of the partitions in the partition map using the
<tt>r</tt> command (see the <prgn>mac-fdisk</prgn> tutorial). In other
words, it's not the physical placement of the bootstrap partition that
counts, it's the logical order within the partition map. Note, though, if
you have an existing system and you shift the partition numbers around, you
will need to make the appropriate changes in <file>/etc/fstab</file>.

<p>

The reason you want the bootstrap partition as partition #2, is so
that it precedes all other partitions in the boot sequence. This helps
tremendously to make the entire system more stable, since some OS's
are very intrusive in their use of partitions.

<p>

When you're finished partitioning, use the <tt>p</tt> command and make note
of the final partition numbers. You will need to know the partition
number for the bootstrap partition, the location of your kernel, and
if you intend to set up <prgn>yaboot</prgn> for multiple OS booting, partition
numbers for your alternate OS's.

<p>

While it's possible to install <prgn>yaboot</prgn> on a mountable HFS
<file>/boot</file> partition, that configuration is deprecated, discouraged
and completely unsupported.

<chapt>Yabootconfig: Make It Easy
<p>

For initial installation on a machine, you can use <prgn>yabootconfig</prgn>
to first create a <file>yaboot.conf</file> file and then install everything
on your bootstrap partition. Yabootconfig reads the running system's
<file>/etc/fstab</file> to determine the kernel location, and detects the
location of the 800k Apple_Bootstrap partition. The Debian installer uses
<prgn>yabootconfig</prgn> behind the scenes in the Make Hard Disk Bootable
step.

<p>

Normally, the initial boot configuration is created while in a ramdisk
installer environment, with the system being installed being mounted under
<file>/target</file> or <file>/mnt</file>. To run <prgn>yabootconfig</prgn>
under these conditions, supply the path to the target system with -t or
--chroot option. For example: <tt>yabootconfig --chroot /target</tt>

<p>

The <file>yaboot.conf</file> automatically created by
<prgn>yabootconfig</prgn> will just control booting of the linux system
under which it was created. To boot additional OS's or add other options,
you will need to edit the <file>yaboot.conf</file> file.


<chapt>Customizing Your Boot Configuration
<p>

To customize your <prgn>yaboot</prgn> installation, use any text editor such
as <prgn>vi</prgn> or <prgn>nano</prgn> (or <prgn>nano-tiny</prgn> in the
Debian installer) to edit the <file>yaboot.conf</file> file. If you used
<prgn>yabootconfig</prgn> to create the initial <file>yaboot.conf</file>, it
will already contain a basic configuration to boot the linux system.

<p>

The <file>yaboot.conf</file> has numerous options; see the
<file>yaboot.conf</file> man page for details. I will briefly cover the most
popular items here. The file controls both <prgn>yaboot</prgn> operation
during tha actual boot, and <prgn>ybin</prgn> operation while saving the
configuration to the boot partition.

<p>

Lines in the file beginning with <tt>#</tt> are interpreted as comments. Each
option or parameter must be specified on a separate line. Don't use
any extra spaces within or following parameter definitions. Also, the
file must have unix newlines; be sure to save as a unix type file
if you create or edit it within MacOS.


<sect>Linux Style Device Paths 
<p>

For those unfamiliar with Linux device naming, partition paths are in
the form of <tt>/dev/xxx#</tt> where xxx is the Linux device name and #
represents the partition number. Typical Linux device names are:

<example>
  Name   Device Type
  ----   --------------------------------------------------
  hda    internal ide drive (primary controller, master disk)
  hdb    internal ide drive (primary controller, slave disk)
  hdc    secondary controller, master disk (often used for CD-ROM)
  hdd    secondary controller, slave disk (often used for Zip drive)
  sda    first SCSI disk (SCSI ID address-wise)
  sdb    second SCSI disk 
  scd0   first CD-ROM (or sr0)
  fd0    first floppy drive
  fd1    second floppy drive
</example>


<sect>OpenFirmware Device Paths
<p>
A utility for finding the OpenFirmware device path corresponding to a
given Linux device path is provided: <prgn>ofpath</prgn>. <prgn>ybin</prgn>
uses <prgn>ofpath</prgn>
internally to convert Linux device names you use in <file>yaboot.conf</file> to
OpenFirmware equivalents. Example: <tt>ofpath /dev/hda</tt> (should return hd:). 
You can also figure out OpenFirmware device paths yourself, see 
Recovering From Misconfiguration below.

<sect>Required Settings
<p>

The bootstrap partition is identified with <tt>boot=boot-partition</tt>,
where boot-partition is the Linux-style path to the bootstrap partition. If
you followed our partitioning recommendations on your internal hard disk,
that would be <tt>boot=/dev/hda2</tt>.

<p>

For PowerMacs, a magicboot line such as 
<tt>magicboot=/usr/local/lib/yaboot/ofboot</tt> is also required. Several
models cannot execute a straight ELF, and need a CHRP script (which this
line in the <file>yaboot.conf</file> makes available).

<p>

The <tt>partition=</tt>, <tt>image=</tt>, and <tt>root=</tt> settings (under
kernel image settings below) are also required.

<sect>Boot Menu Options
<p>

A CHRP script (<file>ofboot</file>) has been provided which
<prgn>ybin</prgn> will modify using <file>yaboot.conf</file> settings, to
display a very handy multi-OS boot menu. 

<p> 

If you are setting up a multi-OS boot menu, you'll need to identify the
partitions where each OS lives. You can use Linux-style or OpenFirmware
partition paths. Here are some examples illustrating the possibilities:

<example>
     macos=/dev/hda10
     macosx=/dev/hda12
     darwin=hd:9
     bsd=zip:1
</example>

When using <tt>macosx=</tt>, if you have OSX installed on a UFS partition,
then point the macosx to the OSX bootstrap partition, not the UFS root.
Don't be tempted to use the OSX bootstrap partition for <prgn>ybin</prgn>,
however &mdash; you still need a separate Apple_Bootstrap partition.

<p>

When using <tt>bsd=</tt>, on the other hand, point to the BSD root
partition, not a bsd bootstrap partition. To use <tt>bsd=</tt>, you also
need to have the bsd bootloader (ofwboot) available in
<file>/usr/local/lib/yaboot/</file> when running <prgn>ybin</prgn>.

<p>

If nothing is selected from the boot menu when it appears, the system
launches <prgn>yaboot</prgn> to start Linux. To launch another OS when no
key is pressed, add a <tt>defaultos=</tt> line, for example
<tt>defaultos=macos</tt> or <tt>defaultos=bsd</tt>.


<sect>Kernel Image Settings
<p>
Kernel images to be launched by yaboot can be kept on any partition,
in an ext2, ext3, XFS, ReiserFS, or HFS/HFS+ filesystem. Yaboot will
need to know the kernel partition number and filesystem path.

<p>

The <file>yaboot.conf</file> file has two sections; most options are in the
global section at the top of the file, and options pertaining to separate
kernel images are grouped together below. Most kernel image options may be
specified either globally or locally; a global option is overridden if it is
re-specified in a kernel image section. Each kernel image section begins
with an <tt>image=/</tt> line specifying the filesystem path to that kernel
image; the first <tt>image=/</tt> line marks the end of the global section.

<p>

Yaboot must know the device, partition number, and filesystem path for the
kernel image that is to be loaded and started. However, <tt>device=</tt> is
usually not necessary, because if you don't specify it <prgn>yaboot</prgn>
assumes it will find the kernel on the same device it was booted from, which
is quite often true. You should always supply the kernel partition number,
for example <tt>partition=3</tt>, and of course the image path (for example
<tt>image=/boot/vmlinux</tt> ). If your kernel image is at the root level of
the parttion, don't forget to include the leading slash when specifying the
image path (<tt>image=vmlinux</tt> will probably fail).

<p>

It's worth noting that <prgn>yaboot</prgn> locates the kernel image within a
partition's filesystem without regard to where that partition will
eventually be mounted within the Linux root filesystem. So, for example, if
you've placed a kernel image or symlink at /boot/vmlinux, but /boot is
actually a separate partition on your system, then the image path for
<prgn>yaboot</prgn> will just be <tt>image=/vmlinux</tt>.

<p>

You must also specify the Linux partition path for the root partition, for
example <tt>root=/dev/hda3</tt>. This parameter is passed to the kernel when
it starts up to let it know where its root filesystem is located. Many other
options are available to pass additional boot parameters to the kernel
(<tt>append=</tt>), specify initial ramdisk size (<tt>ramdisk=</tt>), load a
ramdisk image (<tt>initrd=</tt>), and others. Refer to the yaboot.conf man
page for details on kernel image options.  

<p>

Here's a simple but complete example <file>yaboot.conf</file> with one
kernel image section:

<example>
  # Where's the bootstrap partition
  boot=/dev/hda2
  # CHRP script spec
  magicboot=/usr/lib/yaboot/ofboot
  # Dual boot with MacOS
  macos=hd:14
  # How long to wait at the OS boot menu (seconds)
  delay=5

  # How long to wait at the boot: prompt (tenths of a second)
  timeout=50
  # Globally identified root partition
  root=/dev/hda3 
  # The device where the kernel lives
  device=hd:

  # Kernel image section begins here
  # Specify the filesystem path to the kernel image, symlinks are OK
  image=/vmlinux
      # Specify the partition number where this path is valid
      partition=3
      # Add a label, you can type this at the boot: prompt to load this kernel
      label=Linux
      # Specify the type of root fs mounting, read-only allows fsck to run
      read-only

  ## You must run ybin for changes to take effect!!!!!!!
</example>
<p>

To netboot a kernel image via tftp, use <tt>image=/tftpboot/vmlinux</tt> (the
path on the tftp server) and <tt>device=enet:10.0.0.1</tt>
(substituting the tftp boot server IP address).

<p> 

Normally the first image specified in the <file>yaboot.conf</file> will be the
image booted if no entry is made at the boot: prompt. To have another
image loaded by default, add a <tt>default=label</tt> line in the global
section. 


<sect>Optional and Cool Settings
<p>

Yaboot and your multiboot menu can throw a splash of color into your life!
Use <tt>fgcolor=</tt> and <tt>bgcolor=</tt> lines to set your screen to wake
you up in the morning with black, blue, light-blue, green, light-green,
cyan, light-cyan, red, light-red, purple, light-purple, brown, light-gray,
dark-gray, yellow, and white. Make fgcolor and bgcolor the same if you'd
really like a challenge.

<p>

Add any or all of enableofboot, enablenetboot, or enablecdboot to add
the respective options to your OS boot menu: boot from OpenFirmware,
the network, or CDROM.

<p>

Use Set delay= (in seconds) to determine how long the multiboot OS menu
should wait before booting the default OS. <tt>timeout=</tt> (in tenths of
seconds) to set how long yaboot should wait at the boot: prompt for
you to choose a kernel image before booting the first image in the
file or the <tt>default=</tt> image.

<p>

Booting password protection is available using a <tt>password=</tt> line. 
When you add <tt>password=</tt>, a password will be required for all booting.
Automatic booting is not possible unless a <tt>restricted</tt> line is added.

<p>

If <tt>restricted</tt> is added in the global section, kernel images defined
in <file>yaboot.conf</file> may be booted as long as no arguments are added
at the boot: prompt. This is useful for unattended booting, while preventing
the instant rootshell problems of console access (though OpenFirmare
passwords are also needed to make this really secure, along with locking the
case). To boot an undefined image, or any image with additional arguments, a
password will be required.

<p>

The <tt>password=</tt> line may either be a plaintext password or an MD5
hash (the same format as the Linux <file>/etc/shadow</file> file). To make an
md5 hash use the following perl snippet:

<example>
    $ perl -e 'printf("%s\n", crypt("secret", "\$1\$saltstrg"))'
</example> 
The saltstrg should be a random string, for example one generated by 

<example>
    makepasswd --chars=8
</example>


<chapt>Saving Boot Configuration Changes
<p>

There are currently three utilities provided to save your boot configuration
changes to the boot partition: <prgn>ybin</prgn>, <prgn>mkofboot</prgn>, and
<prgn>yabootconfig</prgn>. Ybin copies <prgn>yaboot</prgn>,
<file>yaboot.conf</file>, and the CHRP script to the boot partition, and
then performs the necessary blessing. Mkofboot initializes the bootstrap
partition, then runs <prgn>ybin</prgn>. And <prgn>yabootconfig</prgn>
creates a working <file>yaboot.conf</file> and then runs
<prgn>mkofboot</prgn>. For details and options of these utilities, see the
associated man pages or type the utility name followed by --help on the
command line.


<chapt>Common Mistakes
<p>

The most common mistake made in the usage of <prgn>yaboot</prgn> is trying
to use it to boot from a mountable partition on a permanent basis. When a
PowerPC first starts up, the booting process is started by locating a
so-called `blessed' folder. The MacOS places the blessing so that multiple
system folders may exist on a partition, but only one of them will be valid
for starting up. If the computer is set up to dual boot Linux and MacOS,
when MacOS is booted it will unbless any folders which do not contain a
valid MacOS system. Then the next time the machine boots, the partition
containing the formerly blessed folder will not be bootable.

<p>

The utilities provided with <prgn>yaboot</prgn> should always be used to set
it up on its own bootstrap partition for regular booting needs. The only
time you should place <prgn>yaboot</prgn> on a mountable partition is for
initial installation of Linux and rescue operations. In those cases you can
intervene in the normal bootloading process to request a specific file to be
executed, and blessed folders are not an issue since this type of booting is
not automatic.

<p>

After <prgn>yaboot</prgn> has been installed, another common mistake is
changing the boot configuration file or updating the <prgn>yaboot</prgn>
software and then failing to re-run the <prgn>ybin</prgn> utility to
transfer the changed configuration to the boot partition. Booting functions
will not be changed unless the changes are saved to the bootstrap partition.
If you change your <file>yaboot.conf</file> often, you might want to add a
comment line inside the <file>yaboot.conf</file> file to remind yourself to
run <prgn>ybin</prgn> after making changes.


<chapt>Recovering From Misconfiguration
<p>

If you have a problem booting, don't panic. Yaboot can boot any
installed Linux kernel and system from the boot: prompt. 

<sect>Resetting the NVRAM
<p>

Hold the Command-Option-p-r keys all together at startup to reset all nvram
parameters to their factory defaults. Hold the keys until you hear the
startup chime two or three times. If the setup recommendations were
followed, the <prgn>yaboot</prgn> installation will be be the first bootable
partition and OpenFirmware will boot it automatically. It should be noted
that MacOS settings such as virtual memory, startup disk, and screen
resolution will also be reset to their defaults.


<sect>Loading Yaboot
<p>

If a <tt>boot:</tt> prompt isn't presented, then <prgn>yaboot</prgn> isn't
being loaded. You can load it manually from
OpenFirmware. Holding the Command-Option-o-f keys all together after
pressing the power-on key will give you an OpenFirmware prompt 

<example>
    0 >
</example>
(Command is the key with the cloverleaf and/or apple engraved on it). 

<p>

At the OF prompt, you will need to use OpenFirmware paths for most of
the boot configuration items. You can determine most OpenFirmware
paths from the OF prompt using a few OF commands, then construct an OF
boot command to directly boot your kernel.

<p>

The full OpenFirmware path consists of three parts in the format 

<example>
    device-name:partition-number,/filesystem-path
</example>

<p>

The OF command devalias will list all the device aliases effective on
your system. You may see some of these:
<example>
  Name      Device Type
  ----      --------------------------------------------------
  hd        internal ide drive (primary controller, master disk)
  ultra1    internal ide drive (primary controller, slave disk)
  ide0      ide drive (secondary controller, master disk)
  ide1      ide drive (secondary controller, slave disk)
  cd        CD-ROM 
  zip       Zip drive
  fw        FireWire interface
  fd        Floppy drive
  enet      Ethernet interface
</example>

Append the partition number of the boot partition (in our recommendation, 2)
and then follow that with <tt>,yaboot</tt> to boot the <prgn>yaboot</prgn>
file on the boot partition.

<example>
    0 > boot hd:2,yaboot 
</example>
<p>

Hit return, and <prgn>yaboot</prgn> should be loaded and display its
<file>boot:</file> prompt. If you don't know the partition number, just
start at 2 and work your way up until you hit it.

<sect>Manually Loading a Kernel Image 
<p>

Once you have the boot: prompt, you can enter a label defined in your
<file>yaboot.conf</file> to boot that kernel image. Or instead of a label,
you can enter a full OpenFirmware path. A typical kernel path might be

<example>
    boot: hd:3,/vmlinux
</example>

To pass parameters to the kernel, add them on to the <tt>boot:</tt> prompt
line after the kernel label or path. You'll need to specify <tt>root=</tt>
as a minimum, but you can add any kernel parameters desired. Here's an
example; 

<example>
    boot: hd:3,/vmlinux root=/dev/hda3 ro
</example>


<chapt>Yaboot as a Temporary Bootloader 
<p>
It's very convenient for certain tasks like installing a new system
the first time without a CD, or rescuing an existing system, to boot a
ramdisk system such as an installer directly from files placed on an
existing partition.

<p>

An example is the Debian installer. It is contained in a floppy-image
root.bin file which <prgn>yaboot</prgn> can boot directly. A simple
<file>yaboot.conf</file> to initialize the ramdisk, yaboot, root.bin, and a
kernel image (named linux in this example) are all that is needed. All files
are placed at the root level on an existing partition.

<p>

The <file>yaboot.conf</file> file for this purpose contains just 
four lines:
<example>
    image=linux
    label=install
    initrd=root.bin
    initrd-size=8192
</example>
<p>

If you create <file>yaboot.conf</file> in the MacOS, you must convert
it to use Unix newlines (linefeeds only). If you use MacOS newlines
(just carriage returns), <prgn>yaboot</prgn> will be unable to read the file.

<p>
Boot into OpenFirmware, and type at the prompt:
<example>
    0 > boot hd:xx,yaboot
</example>

replacing xx with the partition number of the partition where the
kernel and <prgn>yaboot</prgn> files were placed, followed by a return. At the
boot: prompt, type <em>install</em> followed by a return.
